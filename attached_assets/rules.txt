Project Croft: Core UI/UX & System Design Guide and Dev Guide

DO NOT Migrate from in-memory/client storage to proper server-side PostgreSQL database
Continue to use in-memory/client storage

Objective: To establish a consistent, intuitive, and scalable structure for all major modules within the healthcare management system.
1. Foundational Design Principle: The Consistent Module Pattern

Every core element of the system (Patients, Care Plans, Tasks, Reports, etc.) must adhere to a standardized workflow and page structure. This ensures predictability and ease of use.

The Standard Workflow:
On-boarding Wizard -> Master List View -> Detailed Tabbed View
2. Detailed Module Specification

Here is the pattern applied to the Patient module, which will serve as the template for all others.

A. Patient On-boarding Wizard
    Purpose: A guided, step-by-step process to capture all essential information for a new patient efficiently.
    Structure:

        Step 1: Patient Demographics (Name, DOB, NHS Number, etc.)
        Step 2: Contact Details & Address
        Step 3: Next of Kin / Emergency Contact Information
        Step 4: Initial Assessment & Consent Forms
		....

    Outcome: Upon completion, the new patient is created and appears in the Patient List.

B. Patient List View
    Purpose: The primary dashboard for viewing and accessing all patients.
    Initial State: Empty, with a clear call-to-action.
    Key UI Element: A prominent "Add New Patient" button, which launches the On-boarding Wizard.
    Functionality: A searchable, filterable, and sortable table/grid. Clicking any patient record in this list opens the Patient Details Page.

C. Patient Details Page (Tabbed Interface)
    Purpose: A comprehensive hub for all information and actions related to a single patient.
    Mandatory Tabs:

        Overview: A summary dashboard of key patient info, recent activity, and critical alerts.
        Medical History: A dedicated interface to view, add, edit, and manage medical history entries.
        Care Plans: A management console to assign, view, and modify Care Plan Templates for this patient.
        Notes & Communications: A centralized log for all clinical notes, general notes, and internal communications regarding the patient.
		Alerts & Actions: all system raised alerts and actions
        CQC Compliance: A focused view tracking compliance-related data, audits, and evidence required for Care Quality Commission standards.

3. Application to Other Modules
This same pattern must be replicated for:
    Care Plan Templates:
	
        On-boarding Wizard: Step-by-step template creation.
        List View: Table of all templates with an "Add New" button.
        Details Page: Tabs for Template Overview, Associated Tasks, Compliance Mapping, etc.

    Tasks & Rota:
	
        On-boarding Wizard: A guided form to create a new task/shift.
        List View: A consolidated view of the rota/task list.
        Details Page: Tabs for Task Details, Assigned Staff, Completion Status, etc.

    Reports:
	
        On-boarding Wizard: A report builder that guides the user through selecting metrics, filters, and format.
        List View: Saved and previously generated reports.
        Details Page: Tabs for Viewing Report, Editing Parameters, and Scheduling.

4. Global System Settings

A centralized area for administrative control, following the same tabbed principle for organization.
    Location: Clearly accessible from the main navigation (e.g., Gear Icon)
    Tabbed Structure:

        Notifications: Configure alert rules, email/SMS templates, and user preferences.
        User Management: Add staff, assign roles, and manage permissions.
        Holidays & Availability: Manage staff leave, set working patterns, and define availability.
        System Configuration: Broader system settings, integrations, and defaults.
		DB Backup settings: broader backup settings
		Audit trail: Date and time-stamped for all system actions

5. Error Handling & Logging Protocol
To ensure efficient debugging and avoid token-wasting loops, the following mandatory procedure must be implemented for every error or issue encountered.
A. Mandatory Log File Creation

    A file named fixes.txt must be created and maintained in the project's root directory.
    Every single error, issue, or user feedback must be logged as a new, timestamped entry in this file.

B. Structured Log Entry Format
Each entry in fixes.txt must follow this exact structure:
text

[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] - ERROR_ID: <Brief Descriptive Title>
- SOURCE: <User Highlighted / System Encountered during [Task Name]>
- PROBLEM: <Clear, concise description of the erroneous behavior or request.>
- SCOPE ASSESSMENT: [GLOBAL/LOCAL] - <Justification: Why is this a global pattern issue or a local, isolated bug?>
- ACTION TAKEN: <Detailed, step-by-step description of the exact fix implemented.>
- VERIFICATION: <Statement confirming the issue is resolved and the expected behavior now occurs.>
---

C. Critical Workflow Rules to Prevent Loops
    Analysis Before Action: Upon encountering an error, you must first pause and analyze its root cause. Do not immediately start making code changes.
	Consult fixes.txt to see if the problem has been encountered before and effective fixes applied previously
    Scope Assessment is Mandatory: You must explicitly classify the error as:
        GLOBAL: If the issue stems from a foundational component (e.g., the main layout, a shared React component, a core CSS class, a base API function). Fixing it here will apply to all modules.
        LOCAL: If the issue is confined to a single, specific feature, page, or function.
    Plan and Execute the Fix Holistically:
        For a GLOBAL issue, you must identify all other areas in the codebase that might be affected by the same problem and fix them in the same action. Update the log entry's ACTION TAKEN to reflect this comprehensive fix.
        For a LOCAL issue, apply a targeted fix.

    Single Attempt Principle: After implementing the fix, you must verify its success. If the issue is not resolved, do not enter a blind debugging loop. Re-analyze the problem, update the fixes.txt log with the new findings, and then proceed with a revised, informed fix.
    Clarity Over Speed: A well-documented, correct fix is always preferable to a quick, poorly-understood one that may cause further issues.

6. Key Non-Functional Requirements
    CQC Compliance: Data models and UI must be designed with CQC evidence requirements in mind from the outset. The "CQC Compliance" tab is a critical component, not an afterthought.
    Usability: The interface must be clear and easy to navigate for users with varying levels of technical skill.
    Scalability: The architecture should support the addition of new modules in the future by following the established pattern.
