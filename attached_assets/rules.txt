Project Croft: Core UI/UX & System Design Guide and Dev Guide

DO NOT Migrate from in-memory/client storage to proper server-side PostgreSQL database
Continue to use in-memory/client storage

Objective: To establish a consistent, intuitive, and scalable structure for all major modules within the healthcare management system.
1. Foundational Design Principle: The Consistent Module Pattern

Every core element of the system (Patients, Care Plans, Tasks, Reports, etc.) must adhere to a standardized workflow and page structure. This ensures predictability and ease of use.

The Standard Workflow:
On-boarding Wizard -> Master List View -> Detailed Tabbed View
2. Detailed Module Specification

Here is the pattern applied to the Patient module, which will serve as the template for all others.

A. Patient On-boarding Wizard
    Purpose: A guided, step-by-step process to capture all essential information for a new patient efficiently.
    Structure:

        Step 1: Patient Demographics (Name, DOB, NHS Number, etc.)
        Step 2: Contact Details & Address
        Step 3: Next of Kin / Emergency Contact Information
        Step 4: Initial Assessment & Consent Forms
		....

    Outcome: Upon completion, the new patient is created and appears in the Patient List.

B. Patient List View
    Purpose: The primary dashboard for viewing and accessing all patients.
    Initial State: Empty, with a clear call-to-action.
    Key UI Element: A prominent "Add New Patient" button, which launches the On-boarding Wizard.
    Functionality: A searchable, filterable, and sortable table/grid. Clicking any patient record in this list opens the Patient Details Page.

C. Patient Details Page (Tabbed Interface)
    Purpose: A comprehensive hub for all information and actions related to a single patient.
    Mandatory Tabs:

        Overview: A summary dashboard of key patient info, recent activity, and critical alerts.
        Medical History: A dedicated interface to view, add, edit, and manage medical history entries.
        Care Plans: A management console to assign, view, and modify Care Plan Templates for this patient.
        Notes & Communications: A centralized log for all clinical notes, general notes, and internal communications regarding the patient.
		Alerts & Actions: all system raised alerts and actions
        CQC Compliance: A focused view tracking compliance-related data, audits, and evidence required for Care Quality Commission standards.

3. Application to Other Modules
This same pattern must be replicated for:
    Care Plan Templates:
	
        On-boarding Wizard: Step-by-step template creation.
        List View: Table of all templates with an "Add New" button.
        Details Page: Tabs for Template Overview, Associated Tasks, Compliance Mapping, etc.

    Tasks & Rota:
	
        On-boarding Wizard: A guided form to create a new task/shift.
        List View: A consolidated view of the rota/task list.
        Details Page: Tabs for Task Details, Assigned Staff, Completion Status, etc.

    Reports:
	
        On-boarding Wizard: A report builder that guides the user through selecting metrics, filters, and format.
        List View: Saved and previously generated reports.
        Details Page: Tabs for Viewing Report, Editing Parameters, and Scheduling.

4. Global System Settings

A centralized area for administrative control, following the same tabbed principle for organization.
    Location: Clearly accessible from the main navigation (e.g., Gear Icon)
    Tabbed Structure:

        Notifications: Configure alert rules, email/SMS templates, and user preferences.
        User Management: Add staff, assign roles, and manage permissions.
        Holidays & Availability: Manage staff leave, set working patterns, and define availability.
        System Configuration: Broader system settings, integrations, and defaults.
		DB Backup settings: broader backup settings
		Audit trail: Date and time-stamped for all system actions

5. Key Non-Functional Requirements

    CQC Compliance: Data models and UI must be designed with CQC evidence requirements in mind from the outset. The "CQC Compliance" tab is a critical component, not an afterthought.
    Usability: The interface must be clear and easy to navigate for users with varying levels of technical skill.
    Scalability: The architecture should support the addition of new modules in the future by following the established pattern.
