Additional Technical Notes

    Design System: Establish a consistent color palette, typography scale (e.g., for headers, body text), and spacing system (e.g., 8px base unit).

    Component Library: The application requires reusable components for: Cards, Data Tables, Tabs, Badges, Buttons (Primary, Secondary, Text), Form Inputs, and Modals.

    State Management: Consider state for user sessions, patient data caching, and form management, especially for the multi-step onboarding.

    Icons: Plan to integrate a standard icon set for actions (search, edit, add, chevrons, alerts) and medical concepts (pill, heart, syringe).

    Responsiveness: All layouts, particularly the Dashboard metrics grid and data tables, must be fluid and adapt to tablet and mobile views.
