Section 5 — Design Goals & Functional Requirements
This section defines the strategic design goals and the functional requirements your platform must
satisfy to operate as a credible, next-generation replacement for systems like RoundSys and TagCare
(minus payroll). It draws on (1) sector pain points, (2) regulatory expectations, and (3) the literature
review. It sets the foundation for the technical architecture that will follow.
5.1 Strategic Design Goals
5.1.1 Build a Unified Operational SpineThe platform must eliminate fragmentation by consolidating scheduling, care plans, eMAR, task lists,
communication, evidence capture, and reporting into a single coherent ecosystem accessible across
web and mobile. The goal is to become the single source of truth for all operational, clinical, and
compliance data.
5.1.2 Prioritise Real-Time Visibility
Managers should be able to see the live status of every visit, task, alert, incident, and medication
round as it happens. Real-time oversight is essential for safeguarding, compliance, and timely
escalation.
5.1.3 Reduce Administrative Burden
The system must aggressively automate:
• care plan updates,
• daily notes and task generation,
• alert routing,
• evidence compilation for audits,
• rota adjustments,
• missed-visit escalation.
A key success measure: reduce office workload and duplicated data entry by 40–60%.
5.1.4 Deliver a Low-Friction, Carer-Friendly Mobile Experience
Carers operate under time pressure, often with limited technical confidence. The mobile app must
be:
• intuitive within the first 30 minutes of use,
• offline-capable,
• fast to load,
• supportive rather than punitive,
• designed for one-handed use during visits.
5.1.5 Support CQC Compliance by Design
The platform must embed compliance into workflows:
• mandatory task prompts,
• automated risk review reminders,
• digital signatures,
• date/time-stamped logs,
• complete audit trails,
• evidence dashboards aligned with the CQC’s key questions and quality statements.5.1.6 Enable Data-Driven Decision Making
The system should produce actionable intelligence: trends in deterioration, medication compliance,
missed tasks, visit punctuality, carer performance, and capacity utilisation.
5.1.7 Architect for Scale and Interoperability
Digitisation across the UK care sector is rising; your system must anticipate:
• growth from 10 carers → 500 carers → multi-branch structures,
• standardised interfaces (API-first, health-data export),
• integration potential with NHS systems,
• multi-tenancy options for enterprise clients.
5.1.8 Maintain Strong Privacy & Safety Controls
Home care data is highly sensitive. The system must embed:
• GDPR compliance,
• UK data residency,
• fine-grained permissions,
• encryption,
• secure audit logging,
• structured consent management for client/family access.
5.2 Core Functional Requirements
Below are the essential modules your platform must implement.
5.2.1 Client & Care Plan Management
• Create and maintain individual service-user profiles.
• Dynamic, person-centred care plans with goals, preferences, tasks, and risks.
• Version tracking with full history and audit logs.
• Digital signatures (client/representative/carer).
• Automated prompts for risk reviews, care plan updates, and assessments.
Outcome: consistent and compliant person-centred documentation that can be reviewed remotely
and updated in real time.
5.2.2 Visit Scheduling & Rota Generation
• Create weekly/monthly rotas with drag-and-drop interface.• Conflict detection (double bookings, insufficient travel time).
• Automatic distribution of tasks per visit.
• Push notifications to carers for rota changes.
• Optional route optimisation engine (phase 2).
Outcome: fewer missed or late visits, reduced rota errors, and improved workforce utilisation.
5.2.3 Carer Mobile Application
• Secure login (Cognito or equivalent).
• Visit check-in/out (GPS + optional QR/NFC).
• Task-by-task checklist for each visit.
• Voice-to-text notes, photo evidence, incident reporting.
• Offline-first design with local queueing.
• Medication administration recording (non-payroll version still needs eMAR).
• Message centre for updates, policies, and urgent alerts.
Outcome: a simple but powerful digital companion that reduces time spent on notes and improves
record accuracy.
5.2.4 eMAR (Electronic Medication Administration Records)
• Medication schedules linked to the care plan.
• Prompted administration workflow (dose, route, notes).
• Missed-dose escalation.
• PRN protocols and decision support.
• Barcode or NFC medication verification (phase 2).
Outcome: reduced medication errors, clear audit trails, and compliance with safe medication
practices.
5.2.5 Alerts, Incidents & Safeguarding
• Automatic alerts for missed visits, missed medications, falls, deterioration patterns, or
behavioural changes.
• Full incident reporting module with photos, body maps, custom fields.
• Manager escalation rules and notifications.
Outcome: faster response to risk, improved safety, and reduced safeguarding incidents.5.2.6 Document Management & Policies
• Central repository for all documents (S3-backed).
• Policy distribution with read receipts.
• Expiry reminders for training, certificates, and compliance documents.
Outcome: organised governance, easier audits, and protection from non-compliance penalties.
5.2.7 Reporting, Analytics & Dashboards
• Real-time dashboards for visits, incidents, care tasks, medication compliance, and staffing
capacity.
• Exportable reports for commissioners and CQC.
• Longitudinal charts showing trends in notes, risks, delays, incidents, and outcomes.
Outcome: deep managerial oversight and proactive service improvement.
5.2.8 Communication & Family Engagement (Optional Phase)
• Family portal for viewing visit logs, wellbeing notes, and photos.
• Secure messaging with audit trails.
• Consent-based access controls.
Outcome: increased transparency and trust with families.
5.2.9 Admin Features & Workflow Automation
• Carer onboarding hub (documents, training, DBS reminders).
• Automated email/SMS notifications.
• Configurable permissions and multi-role support.
• Multi-branch management (enterprise version).
• No payroll (explicit requirement).
5.2.10 Interoperability & API Requirements
• RESTful API with token-based authentication.
• Hooks for data export to NHS/ICS systems.
• Webhooks for visit events, medication events, and incidents.• Modular microservice-compatible design.
Outcome: system can extend into future integrations without re-architecting
